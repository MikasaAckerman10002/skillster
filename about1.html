                <p>Hello students and childrens, We have made this website for your convenience.
                You can do anything in this website like Listening to music, Reading books,
                Playing flash games to refresh your mind, Reading current affairs, Learning
                new things, Information about sports and watching live sports, This website
                also helps in your school projects, You can also watch your favourite cartoon
                shows and movies. This website also helps you to refer Thesaurus, Dictionary
                and Atlas.</p>
                <p>Don't think that we childrens and students are weak. If we have desire to do
                something big the first thought that comes in our mind is that we are small and
                some think that they are weak. First we should remove this thoughts from our
                mind. If we have will power to do anything we will definately be successful in
                doing that. There are many examples like Former President of INDIA A.P.J ABDUL KALAM
                who dreamt to be a aeronautical engineer and wanted to fly like a bird and finally
                he achieved that, and the great THOMAS ALVA EDISON who was a dull student in
                his school and was driven out of his school, but he did not lose his hope , he
                then worked hard and lighted the whole world. So there are many examples...</p>
                <p>Don't think that this website that you are using is made by elders or any other
                Web Developers. Even we are also students like you guys. We made this website using
                basic HTML Programming. This website is done by Three Friends together.</p>
